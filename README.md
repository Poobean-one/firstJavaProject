This website didn't tell me anthing about how to use it, it just threw a bunch of stuff at me that I didn't understand.
When I try to add a website, it doesn't even include the whole thing, it just puts some of the url and then outs an elipes.
So here is the url to this project cause I don't know how to use this website.
file:///C:/Users/61415/IdeaProjects/Chat%20Bot/ 
If you know how I'm supposed to do this please help by leaving a comment or something or messaging me.
I don't even know how to do that or if you even can do that.
